  Timo Baumann and David Schlangen (2013).
  "Open-ended, Extensible System Utterances 
  Are Preferred, Even If They Require Filled Pauses",
  in Proceedings of SigDIAL, Metz, France,
  
which focuses on the influence of incrementally extended 
open-ended utterances on formulation ratings by users, and in 

  Timo Baumann and David Schlangen (2013).
  "Interactional Adequacy as a Factor in  
  the Perception of Synthesized Speech",
  in Proceedings of SSW8, Barcelona, Spain,
  
which explores the impact of more adequate system formulations
on user ratings of speech synthesis quality.
