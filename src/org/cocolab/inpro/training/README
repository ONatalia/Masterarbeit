DataCollector is a program to collect spontaneous, 
semi-automatically annotated speech data.

The user interface is simplistic, but to the point:

The upper line shows the ASR, while 
the lower line is used for transcription.
As the process alternates between recognition
and transcription phases, only one of these
lines is active at a time.

In the textfield in the ASR line, the current hypothesis
is shown while you speak and recognition is ongoing. It 
may lag behind a little bit. The button on the right of
the ASR line can be used to mute or unmute the microphone.
As the microphone starts up muted, your first step in
using this software will be to unmute the microphone by
pressing this button. Also note that it may take a 
while before the microphone can be unmuted, as the ASR has
to finish loading first. Only commence speaking once the 
button's icon has changed from "pause" to "play". 

The ASR will do its best to recognize what you say and
once you have stopped speaking (and it has finished
processing what you said), the transcription phase
begins:

The transcription line contains the recognized words
in a textfield. There may be errors in the transcription.
(You may actually have spotted them already while 
processing was ongoing.) Now it's your turn: 
(a) to correct the errors, by editing the line so that
    it matches what you said, and 
(b) to get a feeling about the capabilities of the ASR.
 
Once you are happy with the transcription (which, if you
said something like "ja" or "nein" might be immediately),
accept the transcription (by clicking the button with 
the "checkmark" icon).

You will find that the ASR does not like you to talk too 
fast or too slow, too quiet or too loud. And there are 
certain words that it doesn't know. Don't despair! Maybe
you've got more luck if you try a second time, and if you
rephrase you utterance. Maybe it won't help at all. Your
data in such cases is very valuable and will help the ASR
learn the new word with the next training iteration. 

So, if you find a word consistently being mis-understood, 
you may even choose to still use it, in order to "teach" 
the system the new word in several contexts. 
(Unfortunately, teaching means correcting mistakes and 
the system will only have learned the word in the next 
training iteration -- most likely not before the next day.)  

Occasionally, it may seem that the beginning of what you 
said was not picked up. Or that a noise made recognition
hard or impossible. Or that you mispronounced something.
Or some other weird thing happened. Please discard such 
utterances (by clicking the button with the "cross" icon 
to the very right).

Also, occasionally, a new (possibly empty) transcription
might pop up, even though you were still editing the old
transcript. This is a bug, it is not your fault. Please 
press the discard button, to avoid adding a transcription 
to the wrong audio.

Once you have either accepted or discarded a transcription,
the program automatically goes back to the recognition 
step. You do not need to press the button in the ASR line.
(Actually, doing so will mute the microphone, which is not
what you wanted to do.)

Repeat recognition and transcription as often as you want.
You can exit the program at any time by closing the window.

For every utterance, the program stores an audio file 
(.wav), the recognition hypothesis (.hyp) and a transcript
(.ref, unless you discarded this utterance). The files 
will be consecutively numbered, starting from zero. 

By default, your filenames will all start with "utterance."
and will be stored in the "/tmp" directory. You can change
this by clicking the configuration icon in the top right
and entering a different path and file prefix (recognition
has to be paused in order to change the path) or by adding  
-DutteranceWavWriter[outFilePattern]=/your/path/and-file
as the **first** parameter when you call java, or by 
changing the relevant line in the configuration file 
config.xml.
