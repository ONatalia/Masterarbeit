# This file is a template for describing domain-specific AVM structures.
# Hashes start commented lines.
#
# The format of each (non-comment) line is as follows:
# [type:AVM_TYPE attribute:String attribute:AVM_TYPE attribute:(AVM_TYPE,NUM,ORD)]
#
# Where:
#  AVM_TYPE is the type of AVM
#  'String' attributes are initiated as "null" Strings
#  AVM_TYPE attributes are initiated as empty AVMs of the given type.
#  [AVM_TYPE] attributes are initiated as lists of AVMs of the given type.
#  NUM is the number of AVMs in the list.
#  ORD is one of 'true' or 'false' and denotes whether the list is ordered (roughly: monotonic)
#
# Examples:
[type:tile id:String name:String color:String label:String rel_loc:(rel_loc_spec,3,false) loc:loc_spec]
[type:field color:String rel_loc:(rel_loc_spec,3,false) loc:loc_spec]
[type:rel_loc_spec arg:String relation:String]
[type:loc_spec tb:String lr:String desc:String rc:(rc_spec,4,true)]
[type:rc_spec row_col:String orient:String ord:String]
[type:dialog_act act:String]
