Installation instructions for the JAVA programs in the inpro 
project (thus mainly the ASR and closely connected modules).

For the moment there are no build instructions, because we use
Eclipse with Subclipse installed as our build environment.
Figure it out yourself.

Dependencies:
=============

1. Sphinx4 (1.0beta):

get it at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1904&package_id=117949

The current (20071022) nightly builds will likely not work, 
as the configuration management of current Sphinx4 has been 
heavily reworked. 

You can either download and build the source distribution
or just download the binary distribution. All you need is
the library sphinx4.jar that you want to add to your 
CLASSPATH.

While you are there, also grab the different acoustic models
(HUB4, RM1, TIDIGITS and WSJ) and add them to the class path
as well. 

1a. German Acoustic Model:

Several acoustic models are available from helios:/home/timo/tmp/

KCoRS_DE_8gau_13dCep_16k_40mel_130Hz_6800Hz.jar
Cocolab_DE_8gau_13dCep_16k_40mel_130Hz_6800Hz.jar

Acoustic models for German may also be available from Voxforge. 
See http://www.voxforge.org/home/downloads/ for details.

copy the models you want/need and put them in /opt/java/

2. OAA (2.3.2):

get it at http://www.ai.sri.com/oaa/distribution/v2.3/2.3.2/

You will definitely need the facilitator (in runtime/
/facilitator/) and likely the debugger (in runtime/debug/ and
runtime/debug_c/) to run the modules that require to talk
via the OAA.

Also, add the libraries in lib/jar to your CLASSPATH.
( oaa2.jar and antlr-oaa.jar are the only needed ones from the 
OAA-project. The other needed libraries may also be 
installable via your package manager).

3. Java Media Framework (2.1.1):

get it at http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html

You may want to install the version optimized for your OS/
architecture. Add jmf.jar to your CLASSPATH.

4. weka (3.5.x), not yet used.

get it at http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index_downloading.html

Add weka.jar to your CLASSPATH.

5. drej (1.2) 

get it at http://www.gregdennis.com/drej/

and add it to your CLASSPATH. It also requires vecmath.jar,
available from https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html,
which must be added to your CLASSPATH as well.
