Installation instructions for the JAVA programs in the inpro 
project (thus mainly the ASR and closely connected modules).

For the moment there are no explicit build instructions, as we 
use Eclipse with Subclipse installed as our build environment.
An ant build file (exported from eclipse) is provided in the
distribution, but your milleage with this may vary. 

Dependencies:
=============

all dependencies should be covered by the libraries in lib/;
add them to your CLASSPATH / build path

1. MaryTTS:
-----------
For using Incremental Speech Synthesis, a version of 
MaryTTS 4.x must be installed locally and you must set the
mary.base property to point to Mary's location on disk such as 
through using the following switch with Java:
-Dmary.base=/home/timo/uni/projekte/itts/openmary-4.x-branch

You will then have to change the following in your Mary configuration:
in MARY_BASE/conf/marybase.config replace the line
        marytts.modules.HTSEngine \
with
        inpro.synthesis.hts.InteractiveHTSEngine \
in the definition of modules.classes.list .
(You will still be able to use an existing Mary installation 
as before if you add the path to InproTK to Mary's CLASSPATH.) 

You should have Mary's bits1-hsmm voice installed.
  
Please note that the mary-common.jar that we provide in lib/ is 
necessary as it contains some local changes not in the main 
Mary codebase.
