README to the JAVA sources (and programs) in the inpro project 
(thus mainly the ASR and closely connected modules).

0. Resources

The res/ directory contains a few wave files, and some other
useful scripts and stuff.

1. Applications

All generic applications reside in the org.cocolab.inpro.apps package.
This directory is also where the default configuration files
are stored. The configuration file used can be changed in all
applications described below with the commandline switch "-c".
 
- SimpleReco: main starting point into our world. This executable 
starts the speech recognition and all modules that are connected
to it. (Remember? Bottom-up processing.) 
Speech recognition can be configured to run from file (-F), from
microphone (-M) or from the network via RTP (-R; notice that our 
RTP implementation is far from standard-conforming).
There are options for additional output, to control ASR incrementality
filtering, and to control special recognition modes (like forced
alignment or completely fake recognition from a TextGrid). Start
SimpleReco without arguments to get a list of commandline options.

- SimpleText: to test higher-level modules, it is often convenient
to directly input words, instead of just talking into the system.
This allows for more fine-grained, detailed and repeatable testing.
SimpleText allows to do just that. By default, SimpleText will start
in interactive mode. SimpleText -h will give you the list of 
commandline options.

- SimpleRTP: This can be used to forward data via RTP which is 
useful in connection with SimpleReco -R if the recognizer should 
not run on the local machine. 
- SimpleMonitor: Likewise, this program can be used to output data
that is sent to the monitor via RTP.
